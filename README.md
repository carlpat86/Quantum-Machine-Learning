## INTRODUCTION
The promise of quantum computing is that it will address problems that cannot be solved using today's classical computing technology. This is a compilation of the best academic publications on quantum machine learning's current issues and future prospects. 

## GOAL
The goal of the domain of quantum machine learning is to develop quantum software that can perform machine learning tasks at a speed and accuracy that exceeds that of classical computers. We focus on variational quantum classifiers, quantum convolutional neural networks, quantum generative models, quantum kernel-based classification, and quantum k-means clustering algorithms.

## Difference between machine learning and quantum machine learning
Quantum machine learning is a form of machine learning that makes use of qubits, quantum operations, or other types of specialised quantum systems to improve the speed with which algorithms in a programme can compute and store data. Machine learning algorithms are used to compute enormous amounts of data. Without being expressly designed, machine learning programmes can complete tasks. It entails computers learning from available data in order to do specific tasks.
